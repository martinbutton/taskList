Task List

Program to demonstrate PHP OO design, DB access, and GIT management.

Phase 1:
================================
Create simple task list application.  Each row is a task with the following information:

Start Date - Task Title - End Date - Completed Checkbox (Tick)
+ New task button at bottom of task list.

NOTE: If the task row is clicked then it can show further details/comments about the task.  What should be displayed is the same form used to create the task so all fields can be edited, ie. Start date, Task Title, End Date, and Completed checkbox.

Add/Update form:

Start Date: <dd>-<mmm>-<yy> (use datecontrol.js)
End Date: <dd>-<mmm>-<yy>   (use datecontrol.js)
Title: <input type="text">
Comments/Details: <textarea>
Completed <checkbox>
Submit: button
Delete: button (but don't show when creating a new task)

Allow for add/update and deletion of tasks.  Tasks can be updated by simply updating the input fields

DB tables:
id: 		int not null auto_increment primary key
startDate	bigint unsigned
endDate:	bigint unsigned
title:		varchar(255)
comments:	text
email:		varchar(255)

Login: mysql -u taskuser -p<password> tasklist

Create Class "dbControl" to handle DB calls.  ie. open, insert, update and delete.  File: dbControl.php
Create Class "taskView" to handle task representation output and holds in memory db results and getters to get individual field values.
Create Class "taskManager" that creates an instance of "dbControl" and "taskView" and uses it's routines.
- taskManager requires "taskView.php" to assist with IO validation and UI construction.  taskView creates a sanitizedPost[] array and is a dbResults object.

Make "taskView" a class.  Create taskView object which is added to by send SQL results to a taskView setter method.
Create a sanitizedPost[] array with public access in "taskView" which can be used to access validated data input values.

Phase 2:
Allow user logins, use cookies $_COOKIE[], and session data $_SESSION[].

Phase 3:
Make UI/UX better with styling.
Sending of Email Reminders.

Phase 4:
Password generator.
Email confirmation generator.

----

dateField={elem:"From",day:1,month:1,year:2016}; // Object to contain date selection elements
dateField.prototype.setDate; // Prototype functions for dateField objects
dateFieldList[]=dateField; // Array of date field objects
event listener attach to a particular dateFieldList array object.
